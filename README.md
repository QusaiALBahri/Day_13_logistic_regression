Welcome to the **Logistic Regression playground** where theory meets hands-on practice. This repo gives you three complementary notebooks and a small dataset to explore binary classification end to end.

- 📚 **[Masterclass](Day_13_logistic_regression_masterclass.ipynb)** — deep dive into concepts, intuition, and math  
- 🧩 **[Miniclass](Day_13_logistic_regression_miniclass.ipynb)** — condensed, fast track  
- 🏗️ **[Real Example](Day_13_logistic_regression_real_example.ipynb)** — practical, dataset-driven walk-through  
- 📂 **emails.csv** — a small sample dataset to tinker with

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QusaiALBahri/Day_13_logistic_regression.git
cd Day_13_logistic_regression
```

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (preferably in a fresh virtual environment):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Suggested learning path:
1. **Miniclass** → quick overview  
2. **Masterclass** → deeper understanding  
3. **Real Example** → apply on data

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand logistic regression as a probabilistic classifier  
- Interpret coefficients and decision boundaries  
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision/recall, ROC-AUC  
- Practice feature scaling, train/test split, and regularization
